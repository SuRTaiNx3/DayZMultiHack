Oh yeah i just found "Pause" in ReClass, haha 

btw. i've found that BulletPtr + 0x44 + 0x28 = D3DXVECTOR, and i think that is the bullet position itself, am i right?
Yet BulletPtr + 0x44 + 0x44 is... D3DXVECTOR but it has small numbers and they are decreasing so i think that is the bullet drop?
BulletPtr + 0x44 + 0x78 loooks like direction of the fired bullet
BulletPtr + 0x44 + 0x5C, bullet velocity? Seems right because i have AKM and it 7.62x39 bullet velocity/speed is 730 as the game chart says.

Is this everything i need and now i just need to change bullet position to match entity position?
